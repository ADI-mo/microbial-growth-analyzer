ABSTRACT:
Prohibitin (PHB) is overtly conserved evolutionarily and ubiquitously expressed protein with pleiotropic functions in diverse cellular compartments. However, regulation and function of these proteins in different cells, tissues and in various diseases is different as evidenced by expression of these proteins which is found to be reduced in heart diseases, kidney diseases, lung disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis but this protein is highly expressed in diverse cancers. The mechanism by which this protein acts at the molecular level in different subcellular localizations or in different cells or tissues in different conditions (diseases or normal) has remained poorly understood. There are several studies reported to understand and decipher PHB's role in diseases and/or cancers of ovary, lung, stomach, thyroid, liver, blood, prostrate, gastric, esophagus, glioma, breast, bladder etc. where PHB is shown to act through mechanisms by acting as oncogene, tumor suppressor, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, in angiogenesis, autophagy etc. This review specifically gives attention to the functional role and regulatory mechanism of PHB proteins in cardiovascular health and diseases and its associated implications. Various molecular pathways involved in PHB function and its regulation are analyzed. PHB is rapidly emerging as a critical target molecule for cardiovascular signaling. Progress in delineating CVD and mechanisms of PHB in diverse molecular pathways is essential for determining when and how PHB targeted therapy might be feasible. In this regard, new therapies targeting PHB may best be applied in the future together with molecular profiling of CVD for clinical stratification of disease diagnosis and prognosis.

ABSTRACT:
Many bacteria produce storage biopolymers that are mobilized under conditions of metabolic adaptation, for example, low nutrient availability and cellular stress. Polyhydroxyalkanoates are often found as carbon storage in Bacteria or Archaea, and of these polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most frequently occurring PHA type. Bacteria usually produce PHB upon availability of a carbon source and limitation of another essential nutrient. Therefore, it is widely believed that the function of PHB is to serve as a mobilizable carbon repository when bacteria face carbon limitation, supporting their survival. However, recent findings indicate that bacteria switch from PHB synthesis to mobilization under stress conditions such as thermal and oxidative shock. The mobilization products, 3-hydroxybutyrate and its oligomers, show a protective effect against protein aggregation and cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species and heat shock. Thus, bacteria should have an environmental monitoring mechanism directly connected to the regulation of the PHB metabolism. Here, we review the current knowledge on PHB physiology together with a summary of recent findings on novel functions of PHB in stress resistance. Potential applications of these new functions are also presented.

ABSTRACT:
Plastic pollution is fueling the grave environmental threats currently facing humans, the animal kingdom, and the planet. The pursuit of renewable resourced biodegradable materials commenced in the 1970s with the need for carbon neutral fully sustainable products driving important progress in recent years. The development of bioplastic materials is highlighted as imperative to the solutions to our global environment challenges and to the restoration of the wellbeing of our planet. Bio-based plastics are becoming increasingly sustainable and are expected to substitute fossil-based plastics. Bioplastics currently include both, nondegradable and biodegradable compositions, depending on factors including the origins of production and post-use management and conditions. Among the most promising materials being developed and evaluated is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a microbial bioprocessed polyester belonging to the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family. This biocompatible and non-toxic polymer is biosynthesized and accumulated by a number of specialized bacterial strains. The favorable mechanical properties and amenability to biodegradation when exposed to certain active biological environments, earmark PHB as a high potential replacement for petrochemical based polymers such as ubiquitous high density polyethylene (HDPE). To date, high production costs, minimal yields, production technology complexities, and difficulties relating to downstream processing are limiting factors for its progression and expansion in the marketplace. This review examines the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and crystalline characteristics of PHB, as well as various fermentation processing factors which influence the properties of PHB materials.

ABSTRACT:
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in bio-based degradable plastics as an alternative to synthetic plastic. Polyhyroxybutyrate (PHB) is a macromolecule produced by bacteria as a part of their metabolism. Bacteria accumulate them as reserve materials when growing under different stress conditions. PHBs can be selected as alternatives for the production of biodegradable plastics because of their fast degradation properties when exposed to natural environmental conditions. Hence, the present study was undertaken in order to isolate the potential PHB-producing bacteria isolated from the municipal solid waste landfill site soil samples collected from the Ha’il region of Saudi Arabia to assess the production of PHB using agro-residues as a carbon source and to evaluate the growth of PHB production. In order to screen the isolates for producing PHB, a dye-based procedure was initially employed. Based on the 16S rRNA analysis of the isolates, Bacillus flexus (B. flexus) accumulated the highest amount of PHB of all the isolates. By using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer and Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), in which a sharp absorption band at 1721.93 cm−1 (C=O stretching of ester), 1273.23 cm−1 (–CH group), multiple bands between 1000 and 1300 cm−1 (stretching of the C–O bond), 2939.53 cm−1 (–CH3 stretching), 2880.39 cm−1 (–CH2 stretching) and 3510.02 cm−1 (terminal –OH group), the extracted polymer was characterized and confirmed its structure as PHB. The highest PHB production by B. flexus was obtained after 48 h of incubation (3.9 g/L) at pH 7.0 (3.7 g/L), 35 °C (3.5 g/L) with glucose (4.1 g/L) and peptone (3.4 g/L) as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. As a result of the use of various cheap agricultural wastes, such as rice bran, barley bran, wheat bran, orange peel and banana peel as carbon sources, the strain was found to be capable of accumulating PHB. Using response surface methodology (RSM) for optimization of PHB synthesis using a Box–Behnken design (BBD) proved to be highly effective in increasing the polymer yield of the synthesis. With the optimum conditions obtained from RSM, PHB content can be increased by approximately 1.3-fold when compared to an unoptimized medium, resulting in a significant reduction in production costs. Thus, isolate B. flexus is a highly promising candidate for the production of industrial-size quantities of PHB from agricultural wastes and is capable of removing the environmental concerns associated with synthetic plastics from the industrial production process. Moreover, the successful production of bioplastics using a microbial culture provides a promising avenue for the large-scale production of biodegradable and renewable plastics with potential applications in various industries, including packaging, agriculture and medicine.

ABSTRACT:
In the context of a circular economy, bioplastic production using biodegradable materials such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) has been proposed as a promising solution to fundamentally solve the disposal issue of plastic waste. PHB production techniques through fermentation of PHB-accumulating microbes such as Cupriavidus necator have been revolutionized over the past several years with the development of new strategies such as metabolic engineering. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest PHB production technologies via Cupriavidus necator fermentation. The mechanism of the biosynthesis pathway for PHB production was first assessed. PHB production efficiencies of common carbon sources, including food waste, lignocellulosic materials, glycerol, and carbon dioxide, were then summarized and critically analyzed. The key findings in enhancing strategies for PHB production in recent years, including pre-treatment methods, nutrient limitations, feeding optimization strategies, and metabolism engineering strategies, were summarized. Furthermore, technical challenges and future prospects of strategies for enhanced production efficiencies of PHB were also highlighted. Based on the overview of the current enhancing technologies, more pilot-scale and larger-scale tests are essential for future implementation of enhancing strategies in full-scale biogas plants. Critical analyses of various enhancing strategies would facilitate the establishment of more sustainable microbial fermentation systems for better waste management and greater efficiency of PHB production.

TITLE:    A Closer Look on the Polyhydroxybutyrate- (PHB-) Negative Phenotype of Ralstonia eutropha PHB-4
LINK:     https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095907
JOURNAL:  PLoS ONE (2014)
AUTHORS:  

ABSTRACT:

The undefined poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)- (PHB-) negative mutant R. eutropha PHB-4 was generated in 1970 by 1-nitroso-3-nitro-1-methylguanidine (NMG) treatment. Although being scientific relevant, its genotype remained unknown since its isolation except a recent first investigation. In this study, the mutation causing the PHA-negative phenotype of R. eutropha PHB-4 was confirmed independently: sequence analysis of the phaCAB operon identified a G320A mutation in phaC yielding a stop codon, leading to a massively truncated PhaC protein of 106 amino acids (AS) in R. eutropha PHB-4 instead of 589 AS in the wild type. No other mutations were observed within the phaCAB operon. As further mutations probably occurred in the genome of mutant PHB-4 potentially causing secondary effects on the cells' metabolism, the main focus of the study was to perform a 2D PAGE-based proteome analysis in order to identify differences in the proteomes of the wild type and mutant PHB-4. A total of 20 differentially expressed proteins were identified which provide valuable insights in the metabolomic changes of mutant PHB-4. Besides excretion of pyruvate, mutant PHB-4 encounters the accumulation of intermediates such as pyruvate and acetyl-CoA by enhanced expression of the observed protein species: (i) ThiJ supports biosynthesis of cofactor TPP and thereby reinforces the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes as PDHC, ADHC and OGDHC in order to convert pyruvate at a higher rate and the (ii) 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase LeuB3 apparently directs pyruvate to synthesis of several amino acids. Different (iii) acylCoA-transferases enable transfer reactions between organic acid intermediates, and (iv) citrate lyase CitE4 regenerates oxaloacetate from citrate for conversion with acetyl-CoA in the TCC in an anaplerotic reaction. Substantial amounts of reduction equivalents generated in the TCC are countered by (v) synthesis of more ubiquinones due to enhanced synthesis of MenG2 and MenG3, thereby improving the respiratory chain which accepts electrons from NADH and succinate.

TITLE:    Novel Extracellular PHB Depolymerase from Streptomyces ascomycinicus: PHB Copolymers Degradation in Acidic Conditions

ABSTRACT:

The ascomycin-producer strain Streptomyces ascomycinicus has been proven to be an extracellular poly(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) degrader. The fkbU gene, encoding a PHB depolymerase (PhaZSa), has been cloned in E. coli and Rhodococcus sp. T104 strains for gene expression. Gram-positive host Rhodococcus sp. T104 was able to produce and secrete to the extracellular medium an active protein form. PhaZSa was purified by two hydrophobic interaction chromatographic steps, and afterwards was biochemically as well as structurally characterized. The enzyme was found to be a monomer with a molecular mass of 48.4 kDa, and displayed highest activity at 45°C and pH 6, thus being the first PHB depolymerase from a gram-positive bacterium presenting an acidic pH optimum. The PHB depolymerase activity of PhaZSa was increased in the presence of divalent cations due to non-essential activation, and also in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin and PEG 3350. Protein structure was analyzed, revealing a globular shape with an alpha-beta hydrolase fold. The amino acids comprising the catalytic triad, Ser131-Asp209-His269, were identified by multiple sequence alignment, chemical modification of amino acids and site-directed mutagenesis. These structural results supported the proposal of a three-dimensional model for this depolymerase. PhaZSa was able to degrade PHB, but also demonstrated its ability to degrade films made of PHB, PHBV copolymers and a blend of PHB and starch (7∶3 proportion wt/wt). The features shown by PhaZSa make it an interesting candidate for industrial applications involving PHB degradation.

ABSTRACT:

In modern life petroleum-based plastic has become indispensable due to its frequent use as an easily available and a low cost packaging and moulding material. However, its rapidly growing use is causing aquatic and terrestrial pollution. Under these circumstances, research and development for biodegradable plastic (bioplastics) is inevitable. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a type of microbial polyester that accumulates as a carbon/energy storage material in various microorganisms can be a good alternative. In this study, 23 cyanobacterial strains (15 heterocystous and 8 non-heterocystous) were screened for PHB production. The highest PHB (6.44% w/w of dry cells) was detected in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 and the lowest in Spirulina platensis NCCU-S5 (0.51% w/w of dry cells), whereas no PHB was found in Cylindrospermum sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Plectonema sp. Presence of PHB granules in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 was confirmed microscopically with Sudan black B and Nile red A staining. Pretreatment of biomass with methanol: acetone: water: dimethylformamide [40: 40: 18: 2 (MAD-I)] with 2 h magnetic bar stirring followed by 30 h continuous chloroform soxhlet extraction acted as optimal extraction conditions. Optimized physicochemical conditions viz. 7.5 pH, 30°C temperature, 10:14 h light:dark periods with 0.4% glucose (as additional carbon source), 1.0 gl-1 sodium chloride and phosphorus deficiency yielded 26.37% PHB on 7th day instead of 21st day. Using FTIR, 1H NMR and GC-MS, extracted polymer was identified as PHB. Thermal properties (melting temperature, decomposition temperatures etc.) of the extracted polymer were determined by TGA and DSC. Further, the polymer showed good tensile strength and young’s modulus with a low extension to break ratio comparable to petrochemical plastic. Biodegradability potential tested as weight loss percentage showed efficient degradation (24.58%) of PHB within 60 days by mixed microbial culture in comparison to petrochemical plastic.
