# 🧬 Science Fetcher Pro - Ultimate Edition

**A smart multi-source scientific search engine that unifies 5 databases into one powerful tool.**

This tool is designed for researchers and students who want a complete overview of a research topic without having to manually search five different websites. The system fetches articles, removes duplicates, ranks them by relevance and impact, and allows for convenient data export to Excel/CSV.

---

## 🌟 Why is this tool useful? (Key Features)

1.  **Massive Time Saver:** Instead of searching separately on PubMed, Semantic Scholar, and Europe PMC – you get everything in one place.
2.  **Smart Ranking Algorithm:** The system doesn't just "dump" results. It calculates which article best matches your search terms (is the word in the Title?) and combines that with the Citation Count (Impact).
3.  **Quality First:** The system prioritizes reliable medical sources (like PubMed) to prevent "noise" from less authoritative sources.
4.  **Direct File Access:** Automatically detects free **Open Access PDF** links and displays them in a separate button.
5.  **Data Export:** Save results as a **CSV** (for Excel analysis) or as a readable **Text file**.

## 🚀 What's New in this Version? (Change Log)

We have performed a comprehensive upgrade to the engine and interface (Backend & GUI):

### 🧠 Algorithm & Logic Improvements
* **New Relevance Score Model:**
    * An article gets **100 points** if the search term appears in the **Title**.
    * An article gets **10 points** if the search term appears in the **Abstract**.
    * **Special Bonus (5000 points):** Awarded to articles from **PubMed** and **Europe PMC** to ensure reliable medical sources appear at the top of the list.
* **Combined Sorting Mechanism:** Results are sorted first by **Relevance Score**, and in case of a tie, by **Citation Count (Impact)**.
* **Decimal Year Fix:** Fixed an issue where years were displayed as `2015.0`. They are now correctly displayed as `2015`.
* **PLOS Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue that caused PLOS author names to be missing.

### 🖥️ Interface (GUI) Upgrades
* **Link Separation:** Distinct buttons for the article page (`Open Article`) and the download link (`Open PDF`) to avoid confusion.
* **Clean View:** Abstracts in the table are truncated to 50 characters ("...") to prevent visual clutter (but are saved fully in the export).
* **Flexible Export:** A new `EXPORT DATA` button opens a selection window between **CSV** (for tables) and **Text** (for reading).
* **Smart Filename:** The save filename is automatically generated based on your search term (e.g., `DNA_Repair_results.csv`).

### 🛠️ Stability
* **Crash Protection:** The system handles missing years, missing abstracts, or momentary network timeouts without crashing.
* **Code Cleanup:** Removed non-English comments and fixed indentation issues to prevent runtime errors.

## ⚙️ Installation Requirements

The system is written in Python 3 and uses standard libraries as much as possible to keep it lightweight and fast.

### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have [Python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer.

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Open your Terminal (or CMD) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install requests

````markdown


*(This is the only external library required. All others - `tkinter`, `csv`, `json`, `threading` - are built-in).*

### 3\. (Optional) Create an EXE file

If you want to turn the script into a standalone software file (to share with friends):

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

-----

## ▶️ How to Run?

### Option A: Running the Code (For Developers)

1.  Ensure all three files are in the same folder:
      * `main.py` (The main entry point)
      * `unified_client.py` (Search engine and logic)
      * `ncbi_client.py` (PubMed connection)
2.  Open the terminal in that folder and run:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Option B: Creating an EXE (For Regular Use)

To create a file that runs with a double-click (no VS Code needed):

1.  Open the terminal in the project folder.
2.  Run the command:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --clean --name="ScienceFetcher" main.py
    ```
3.  The ready-to-use file will appear in the `dist` folder.

## 🤖 AI Usage & Transparency

This project was developed with the assistance of Generative AI tools (LLMs). The AI acted as a "Pair Programmer" throughout the development cycle.

### Methodology

The development process involved an iterative dialogue where requirements were defined, code was generated, and bugs were resolved based on error logs provided by the developer.

### Prompts & Commands Used

The following types of prompts were used to guide the AI in building this software:

1.  **Architecture Setup:**

    > "Create a Python project with a modular structure. I need a client to fetch data from NCBI PubMed using their API and parse the XML response."

2.  **Multi-Source Expansion:**

    > "Extend the search capability to include Semantic Scholar, Europe PMC, and OpenAlex. Merge duplicates based on the article title."

3.  **Algorithm Design:**

    > "The search results are not sorted correctly. Implement a 'Relevance Score' algorithm: give 100 points if the keyword is in the title, and 10 points if it is in the abstract. Prioritize PubMed results."

4.  **GUI Development:**

    > "Build a GUI using Tkinter. It should have a search bar, a scrollable text area for results, and buttons to open links. Make sure it supports right-click paste."

5.  **Debugging & Refinement:**

    > "I am getting an `IndentationError` in `unified_client.py`. Please fix the code structure and remove any circular imports in `ncbi_client.py`."

6.  **Feature Implementation:**

    > "Add a feature to export the search results to a CSV file. The filename should automatically include the search term."

**Verification:** All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and integrated by the human developer to ensure accuracy, security, and functionality.

## 📚 Data Sources Used

The system scans the following databases simultaneously:

1.  **PubMed:** (Top Priority) - The world's leading medical database.
2.  **Semantic Scholar:** AI-based engine providing excellent Citation data.
3.  **Europe PMC:** European repository often containing Open Access papers not found in PubMed.
4.  **OpenAlex:** Massive index of articles, used to fill in missing data (like citation counts).
5.  **PLOS:** Publisher of Open Access articles only.
